# hidename
Simple Steam skin that hides your original account name

# Summary
Valve's Steam has been around for over a decade, which is plenty of time for one's personal sense of identity to change.
While Valve allows you to change you account nickname, which is generally how friends see you on Steam, they forbid changing
your original username that is used to sign in and is constantly visible to you in the Steam UI.  Furthermore, if you create
a new Steam account, you lose all the games you purchased on the old one.

This skin is an attempt to alleviate annoyances and incongruity at seeing one's old name in the Steam UI.  For now, all it
does is hide your username in the upper right hand corner of the Steam window.  I will attempt to update it to hide your
username in as many other places as I can.  If you have any problems or suggestions, please open an issue.  If you would like
to improve this skin yourself, feel free to submit a pull request!

# Installation

1. Copy the hidename directory to your Steam install's skins folder.  The usual locations per OS are:
    * Ubuntu: `~/.steam/skins/`
    * Other Linux Distros: `~/.local/share/Steam/skins/`
    * OS X: `/Users/<Username>/Library/Application Support/Steam/Steam.AppBundle/Steam/Contents/MacOS/skins/`
    * Windows: `/Program Files/Steam/skins/`
2. Open Steam, go to Settings (or Preferences on OS X), click the Interface tab, and choose "hidename" as your new skin.
3. Restart Steam, and your old username in the upper right hand corner should be replaced with a profile icon.
